The Cornell method provides a systematic format for condensing and organizing notes. The most common way of taking notes is the "two column" notes. The student will divide the paper into two columns: the note-taking column and the questions column. The student should leave five to seven lines, or about two inches (5 cm), at the bottom of the page.
Walter Pauk devised the Cornell Notes system in 1940s.
The Cornell method is effective because it helps us review systemically.
